It consists of a common heteromeric core enzyme, which is composed of a catalytic subunit and a constant regulatory subunit, that associates with a variety of regulatory subunits. The B regulatory subunit might modulate substrate selectivity and catalytic activity. This gene encodes a beta isoform of the regulatory subunit B55 subfamily. Defects in this gene cause autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia 12 (SCA12), a disease caused by degeneration of the cerebellum, sometimes involving the brainstem and spinal cord, and in resulting in poor coordination of speech and body movements. Multiple alternatively spliced variants, which encode different isoforms, have been identified for this gene. The 5' UTR of some of these variants includes a CAG trinucleotide repeat sequence (7-28 copies) that can be expanded to 55-78 copies in cases of SCA12. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2016]"
138,TNFRSF10A,8797,TNF receptor superfamily member 10a,"The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the TNF-receptor superfamily. This receptor is activated by tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TNFSF10/TRAIL), and thus transduces cell death signal and induces cell apoptosis. Studies with FADD-deficient mice suggested that FADD, a death domain containing adaptor protein, is required for the apoptosis mediated by this protein. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]"

142,NR1I2,8856,nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group I member 2,"This gene product belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily, members of which are transcription factors characterized by a ligand-binding domain and a DNA-binding domain. The encoded protein is a transcriptional regulator of the cytochrome P450 gene CYP3A4, binding to the response element of the CYP3A4 promoter as a heterodimer with the 9-cis retinoic acid receptor RXR. It is activated by a range of compounds that induce CYP3A4, including dexamethasone and rifampicin. Several alternatively spliced transcripts encoding different isoforms, some of which use non-AUG (CUG) translation initiation codon, have been described for this gene. Additional transcript variants exist, however, they have not been fully characterized. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]"
143,GYPE,2996,glycophorin E (MNS blood group),"The protein encoded by this gene is a sialoglycoprotein and a type I membrane protein. It is a member of a gene family with GPA and GPB genes. This encoded protein might carry the M blood group antigen. GYPA, GYPB, and GYPE are organized in tandem on chromosome 4. This gene might have derived from an ancestral gene common to the GPB gene by gene duplication. Two alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein have been described for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]"
